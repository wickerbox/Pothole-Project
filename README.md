# Pothole Project
Developing a low-cost device to collect and report real-time road information for cities. 

#### Step 1

Arduino 101 Shield using Fona, OBD-II/CAN circuitry, and an SD card. The board schematic was designed but not reviewed; the board was never laid out. 

Next step: lay out the board in KiCad and assemble a prototype

#### Step 2 

Standalone board using Fona, Curie chip, OBD-II/CAN circuitry, and an SD card. Ideally, it would fit into port so it could be left there to just do its thing.
